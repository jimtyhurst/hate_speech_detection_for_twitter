# Hate Speech Detection in Twitter
As people are starting to study the problem of hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms, they are creating data sets of tweets that are encoded with various ratings. This repository is for experimenting with those data sets.

These experiments and utilities are written in the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/).
